# GRsync

**NOTE: This is a fork of https://github.com/clyang/GRsync: added Python3 support and disable Camera shutdown after download**


GRsync is a handy Python script, which allows you to sync photos from Ricoh GR II or III via Wifi. It has been tested on Mac OS X and Ubuntu, and should be able to run on any platform that has a Python environment.

It automatically checks if photos already exists in your local drive. Duplicated photos will be skipped and only sync needed photos for you.

**NOTE: Ricoh GR II only supports 20MHz 802.11n. The max transfer speeed I can get is 65Mbps**

## Installaion
1. Get the source from Github
 
```bash
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clyang/GRsync/master/GRsync.py
$ chmod +x GRsync.py
```

2. Assign the downloaded photo directory. Edit `GRsync.py`
 
```python
# Change the value of PHOTO_DEST_DIR
# Don't forget the tailing "/"
PHOTO_DEST_DIR = "/path/to/downloaded/photos/"
```

## Usage
1. Connect your desktop/laptop to Ricoh GR II's Wifi network. (SSID: RICOH_XXXXX)
2. Simple usage - Download ALL photos from Ricoh GR II or III via Wifi

```bash
./GRsync -a
```

3. Advanced usage - Download photos after specific directory and file

```bash
./GRsync -d 100RICOH -f R0000005.JPG
```
